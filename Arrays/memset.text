The memset function in C++ is a standard library function used to fill 
a block of memory with a particular value. It's commonly used for  
initializing arrays or buffers.


Syntax:
void* memset(void* ptr, int value, size_t num);

(a). ptr: A pointer to the block of memory to fill.
(b). value: The value to be set. This value is passed as an int, but the function fills the 
block of memory using the unsigned char conversion of this value.
(c). num: The number of bytes to be set to the value.
